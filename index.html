                          best in my specialty and to do for our world what will help improve it. 
                          I cannot sit in one place, I need to move forward, learn something new 
                          every day, which will take me to a new level.<br><br>

                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am by nature a purposeful person who is not afraid of obstacles and

                          is his desire to learn every day and love his job that he does. After 
                          all, the essence of our whole life is learning. Life is one big

                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started my training in front-end development in February, 2020. At first, 
                          I was fond of creating a general look and displaying content using HTML, then 
                          I connected CSS. Studied on YouTube videos and read various documentation 
                          related to web development. I completed a basic course on site layout in 
                          <a href="https://go.skillbox.ru/" target="_blank">Skillbox</a>, which includes HTML / CSS and JavaScript. Studied different tags 
                          on the <a href="https://webref.ru/" target="_blank">WedReference</a> website. And also there is knowledge in Javascript. Also 
                          I understand Photoshop through Adobe Photoshop and Figma. Of course, then 
                          knowledge in this area was at a basic level, but now having entered the Rolling 
                          Scopes School, I got a lot of motivation to learn and develop in front-end development.<br><br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="forth-about">
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned about the course from the Instagram of Epam Kazakhstan and immediately 
                          registered there. I knew that, this was my chance and I shouldn't miss it.Since 
                          having plunged into the world of the front-end and communicating with students 
                          from RS School, I see how they develop themselves, help each other and this is 
                          just a brain explosion, there is so much motivation and knowledge that I want to learn and develop.
