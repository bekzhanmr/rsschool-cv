## Summary
What is my goal? 
My goal is *self-realization*, to become the best of the best in my specialty and to do for our world what will help improve it. I cannot sit in one place, I need to move forward, learn something new every day, which will take me to a new level.

I am by nature a purposeful person who is not afraid of obstacles and achieves his goal. I believe that the most important thing in a person is his desire to learn every day and love his job that he does. After all, the essence of our whole life is learning. Life is one big school - "School of Life".

I started my training in front-end development in February, 2020. At first, I was fond of creating a general look and displaying content using HTML, then I connected CSS. Studied on YouTube videos and read various documentation related to web development. I completed a basic course on site layout in [Skillbox](https://go.skillbox.ru/), which includes HTML / CSS and JavaScript. Studied different tags on the [WedReference](https://webref.ru/) website. And also there is knowledge in Javascript.
Also I understand Photoshop through Adobe Photoshop and Figma. Of course, then knowledge in this area was at a basic level, but now having entered the **Rolling Scopes School**, I got a lot of motivation to learn and develop in front-end development. 

I learned about the course from the Instagram of **Epam Kazakhstan** and immediately registered there. I knew that, this was my chance and I shouldn't miss it.Since having plunged into the world of the front-end and communicating with students from RS School, I see how they develop themselves, help each other and this is just a brain explosion, there is so much motivation and knowledge that I want to learn and develop.

        if (i % 5 === 0) temp += 'Buzz';
